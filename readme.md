# GitHub Learning Lab config file Linter

**This is WIP** If you decide to use it anyway please report any issues that you find :)

```
yarn global add github-learning-lab-linter
lab-linter config.yml
```

It currently finds issues in actions inside the steps, based in the configuration in the [`actions-spec.json`](actions-spec.json) file.
